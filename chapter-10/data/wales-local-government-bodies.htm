                    <h3>Unitary authorities in Wales</h3>

                    <p>Wales’ 22 unitary authorities (county and county borough councils – also known as ‘principal
                      councils’) deliver a wide range of services. Some, for example education,&nbsp;they are required
                      by law to make available; others are provided at the discretion of individual authorities. A
                      typical list of local authority services includes:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>planning and building control</li>
                      <li>education</li>
                      <li>trading standards</li>
                      <li>alcohol, entertainment and gambling licensing</li>
                      <li>health and safety</li>
                      <li>libraries, leisure and tourism</li>
                      <li>environmental health, refuse and recycling</li>
                      <li>transport and highways</li>
                      <li>housing</li>
                      <li>social services.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>While the history of local government in Wales stretches back at least to the 16th century, the
                      existing 22 Welsh single-tier, unitary authorities date from 1996 having been established by
                      the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/19/contents?lang=en">Local Government
                        (Wales) Act 1994</a>. They are not divided into county and district councils, as local
                      authorities are in much of England. On a more local level, community and town councils provide
                      services in their immediate areas.</p>

                    <p>All local authorities are democratically accountable through elections held every 4 years. Local
                      authorities have a cabinet style executive with the dominant political group or coalition making
                      decisions under the scrutiny of the council as a whole. They employ large numbers of staff headed
                      by a chief executive, who works with other senior officers on day-to-day business and
                      decision-making.</p>

                    <p>The unitary authorities in Wales are:</p>

                      </li>
                      <li>Newport City Council (Cyngor Dinas Casnewydd)</li>
                      <li>Pembrokeshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Penfro)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>All unitary authorities in Wales are members of the&nbsp;<a
                        href="http://www.wlga.gov.uk/?lang=en">Welsh Local Government Association</a>&nbsp;(WLGA). The
                      WLGA represents their collective views and interests and advises and supports individual
                      authorities.</p>

                    <h3>Community and town councils in Wales</h3>

                    <p>Community and town councils are the grassroots level of local governance in Wales. There are over
                      730 community and town councils throughout Wales. Some represent populations of fewer than 200
                      people, others populations of over 45,000 people. Their purpose is to improve the quality of life
                      and environment for citizens in their area.</p>

                    <p>Community and town councils are accountable to local people and have a duty to represent the
                      interests of the different parts of the community equally.</p>

                    <h3>National Park Authorities in Wales</h3>

                    <p>The three National Park Authorities in Wales are:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Snowdonia National Park</li>
                      <li>Brecon Beacons National Park</li>
                      <li>Pembrokeshire Coast National Park</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The statutory purposes, functions and duties of National Parks are set out in Part 3 of the <a
                        href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/25/contents">Environment Act 1995</a>.</p>

                    <p>Their statutory purposes are:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National
                        Park</li>
                      <li>to promote opportunities for public enjoyment and understanding of the special qualities of
                        the National Park</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Their statutory duty is to foster the economic and social well-being of communities living within
                      the National Park.</p>

                    <p>The three Welsh National Park Authorities work in partnership as National Parks Wales (NPW). NPW
                      provides National Park Authorities with the means of identifying issues of joint interest and
                      agreeing outputs. &nbsp;Information and experiences are shared between colleagues, policy makers,
                      local communities within the National Parks and visitors to these protected areas.</p>

                    <h3>Fire and Rescue Authorities in Wales</h3>

                    <p>The three Fire and Rescue Authorities in Wales are:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>North Wales Fire and Rescue Authority</li>
                      <li>Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Authority</li>
                      <li>South Wales Fire and Rescue Authority</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Their responsibilities and duties are principally governed by the&nbsp;<a
                        href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/21/contents?lang=en">Fire and Rescue Services Act
                        2004</a>. This Act requires all fire authorities to make provision for firefighting purposes,
                      which not only means putting out fires but also includes protecting life and property from fire.
                      It also makes provision for attending road traffic collisions and other emergencies as well as
                      providing a statutory footing for undertaking community safety activities. Additionally,
                      the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made?lang=en">Regulatory
                        Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a>&nbsp;requires all fire authorities to enforce fire safety
                      standards in a variety of commercial premises such as offices, shops, schools, factories,
                      hospitals etc.</p>

                    <p>Responsibility for the three fire and rescue services in Wales was devolved in 2004. In
                      accordance with the transfer of responsibilities the Welsh Government regularly produces
                      the&nbsp;<a
                        href="http://www.southwales-fire.gov.uk/English/home/Documents/Fire_and_Rescue_National_Framework_eng.pdf">Fire
                        and Rescue National Framework</a>&nbsp;which sets out priorities and objectives for fire and
                      rescue in Wales.</p>
