# Solve Any Data Analysis Problem

Hello!

This repository contains the accompanying data and example solution code for the Manning book "Solve Any Data Analysis Problem".

In each chapter folder, you will find the data files required to attempt the project along with Jupyter notebooks containing the example solution code, which I walk through in great detail in the book.

In the future, different versions of the libraries may produce different results, so I have included the files required to recreate the virtual environment I used for the solutions. The use of these is detailed in an appendix in the book.

As I say in the book, I recommend attempting the projects yourself before looking at the example solutions.

Have fun!

David
